Head over to this [link][link] to see the application.


**Question**<br>
We are in the midst of a global cov19 pandemic. Each day, the ministry of health(moh) in Singapore releases a report on the number of new case of infection and other related informaion.
An example is [this link][link2]. Is it possible to extract key information from the text?
This would allow a quick view of the daily numbers without have to read the entire text and also allow us to do build visualisations and do more analysis.
Can we also make it automated, so no human intervention is needed. The charts update daily based on the new reports posted by moh.

**Process**<br>
We attempt to answer the question above in [link][link].<br><br>
